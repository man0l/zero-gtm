## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a credit?**  
One credit = one lead processed through one pipeline step (e.g. one lead through "Find Emails" or one through "Find Decision Makers"). If a step uses your own API key (BYOK), that step does not deduct credits.

**Do BYOK steps use my credits?**  
No. When you provide your own API key for a service (RapidAPI, OpenWeb Ninja, Anymail Finder, OpenAI/Anthropic), that step runs with your key and does not consume your plan credits. You only pay your API provider; ZeroGTM does not charge for that step.

**What is included in Self-Hosted?**  
Self-hosted means you run the backend (Supabase or compatible), workers, and optional Edge Functions on your own infrastructure. There are no per-seat or per-credit fees from ZeroGTM—you pay only for your APIs (e.g. RapidAPI, email finder, enrichment) and compute. Full pipeline: **Google Maps scraper**, **lead enrichment**, **email finder**, decision maker discovery.

**Can I switch plans or cancel?**  
Yes. Upgrade or downgrade from the app (Settings or Billing). Cancel anytime; you keep access until the end of the billing period. Self-hosted has no subscription to cancel.

**Which plan is right for small teams?**  
**Starter** ($49/mo, 1,000 credits) fits small teams running a few campaigns and CSV export. **Growth** ($99/mo, 3,000 credits, unlimited campaigns and Sheets export) fits teams scaling outreach. Start Free to try the pipeline, then move to Starter or Growth as volume grows.

**Does ZeroGTM offer a free trial?**  
The **Free** plan (100 credits/mo, 2 campaigns) works as a trial: you can run the full pipeline end-to-end and export (view only). No credit card required. Upgrade when you need more credits or export options.
