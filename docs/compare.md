# Compare ZeroGTM

How **AI SDR agents** and **b2b lead enrichment tools** stack up—and why ZeroGTM is built for GTM engineers who want control and unit economics that scale.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Human SDR

| | Human SDR (Annual) | ZeroGTM (Annual) |
|--|--------------------|------------------|
| **Compensation** | $60,000 | $0 |
| **Tech stack** | ~$3,000 | ~$6,000 (APIs/compute) |
| **Management** | ~$12,000 | ~$2,000 (ops/eng) |
| **Total** | **$98,000** | **$28,000** |
| **Savings** | — | **71%** |

You keep signal-driven outreach and pipeline control, without the fixed cost of a full-time SDR. The pipeline—**Google Maps scraper** → clean → **email finder** → decision makers → verification—runs as jobs you trigger from the mobile app; you approve leads and own the data. No headcount, no ramp time, no turnover.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Apollo

**Apollo** is a closed-source sales intelligence and engagement platform. You pay per seat and per contact; data lives in Apollo’s cloud and syncs via their API. It’s powerful for outbound at scale but locks you into their ecosystem and pricing.

**ZeroGTM** takes a different bet: open-source pipeline and your database. You run a **Google Maps scraper** and **lead enrichment** (emails, phones, decision makers) on your infra or a hosted tier. No per-seat tax; credits apply to pipeline steps, and **BYOK** (bring your own API keys) means steps that use your keys don’t consume credits. Best for teams that want an **email finder tool** and **lead enrichment software** they can own, tune, and self-host—without sending lead lists to a third-party cloud. If your priority is owning the enrichment pipeline and keeping data in-house, ZeroGTM is the alternative to Apollo's closed ecosystem.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Clay

**Clay** is a no-code data enrichment and outreach platform. You build “tables” and workflows that call enrichment APIs (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.) and send emails. Pricing scales with rows and integrations; your data flows through Clay’s infrastructure.

**ZeroGTM** is code-first and pipeline-first: one enrichment pipeline (map scrape → clean → find emails → find decision makers → verify) orchestrated as jobs. Your data stays in PostgreSQL; you can self-host so nothing leaves your stack. If you prefer **GTM engineering as code**—configurable workers, your API keys, your database—ZeroGTM fits. If you want a no-code spreadsheet-style builder, Clay may be a better fit. For **b2b lead enrichment tools** that prioritize ownership and **best lead enrichment for sales teams** with transparent unit economics, ZeroGTM is the alternative.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Instantly and Cold Email Senders

**Instantly**, **Lemlist**, **Smartlead**, and similar tools focus on *sending*: warmup, sequences, and deliverability. They assume you already have a list of leads and emails.

**ZeroGTM** focuses on the *front of the funnel*: building that list. It’s a **Google Maps scraper** plus **lead enrichment** and **email finder** pipeline. You get hyper-local leads from Maps, clean them, find contacts and decision makers, and verify emails—then export or send via your own stack (or plug into another tool). So the comparison isn’t “either/or”: ZeroGTM fills the gap before you need Instantly. Teams that need **lead generation** and **email finder by name** (or **email finder by phone number** where supported) first, then sequences second, get more value from ZeroGTM’s pipeline.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Instantly (sending vs building the list)

Cold email tools like **Instantly** excel at sending: warmup, sequences, and deliverability. ZeroGTM excels at *building* the list before you send. Use ZeroGTM to get hyper-local leads from Google Maps, enrich them, find decision makers and verify emails; then export or push those contacts into Instantly (or Lemlist, Smartlead, etc.) for sequences. Together they cover the full flow from discovery to inbox.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Outreach and Salesloft

**Outreach** and **Salesloft** are enterprise sales engagement platforms: sequences, dialers, analytics, and CRM integrations. They’re built for sales teams that already have a defined process and want to automate touchpoints. Pricing is per-seat and often high; data lives in their systems.

**ZeroGTM** doesn’t replace your CRM or sequences—it feeds them. It’s the engine that *creates* the leads: **Google Maps** → clean → **lead enrichment** → **decision maker** discovery → **email finder** verification. You run it self-hosted or on a hosted tier, then push enriched leads into your CRM or your preferred sending tool. For GTM engineers who want to own the *source* of pipeline (local-first, signal-driven) and keep unit economics in check, ZeroGTM is the layer before Outreach or Salesloft.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Black-Box AI Platforms

Many **AI SDR** platforms charge $2k+/month and hide how they work: proprietary models, opaque enrichment, and data sent to their cloud.

**ZeroGTM** is open-source. You see the pipeline (Google Maps → clean → **email finder** → decision makers → verification). Run it self-hosted or use a hosted tier. Your leads stay in your database; no “sync states” or sending lists to third-party clouds. **Customization**: swap APIs, add steps, tune prompts. It’s **GTM engineering as code**.

---

## ZeroGTM vs Task-Based Automation (Zapier, Make, etc.)

**Zapier** and **Make** (Integromat) are great for one-off automations and small workflows. At scale, task-based automation gets expensive (per-task pricing) and brittle (many connectors, rate limits, and failure points).

**ZeroGTM** is one enrichment pipeline—map scrape, **lead enrichment**, **email finder**—orchestrated and run as jobs. No per-task surprises; you pay for credits (or use BYOK and pay only APIs/compute). **Mobile-first**: manage campaigns and approve leads from your phone, not a maze of tabs.

## Quick comparison summary

| Need | Apollo / Clay | Instantly / Lemlist | Outreach / Salesloft | ZeroGTM |
|------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Enrichment + email finder** | Cloud, per-seat | Not focus | Tied to CRM/sequences | Pipeline you own, BYOK |
| **Google Maps → leads** | Limited | No | No | Native (RapidAPI) |
| **Self-host / data at rest** | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Open-source** | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Best for** | Teams wanting all-in-one cloud | Teams that have lists and need sending | Enterprise sales engagement | GTM engineers, data ownership |

Choose ZeroGTM when data ownership, self-hosting, and a transparent pipeline matter more than a single-vendor suite. You keep full control of the enrichment pipeline and your data at all times.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does ZeroGTM compare to a human SDR?**  
A human SDR typically costs about $98,000 per year (compensation, tech stack, management). ZeroGTM runs at roughly $28,000 per year (APIs and ops)—about 71% savings—while keeping pipeline control and signal-driven outreach. You keep the same workflow: approve leads, trigger sequences, and own the data.

**What is the difference between ZeroGTM and Apollo or Clay?**  
Apollo and Clay are closed-source, cloud-only platforms with per-seat or usage-based pricing and data stored in their systems. ZeroGTM is open-source: you see and own the pipeline (Google Maps scrape, lead enrichment, email finder, decision maker discovery). You can self-host so leads stay in your database, use BYOK to avoid credit burn, and customize steps and APIs without vendor lock-in.

**Is ZeroGTM better than Instantly or other cold email tools?**  
Instantly and similar tools focus on sending and sequences. ZeroGTM focuses on the front of the funnel: finding and enriching leads (Google Maps scraper, email finder, decision maker discovery). It’s built for teams that need a single pipeline from map scrape to verified contacts, then use their own sending stack or integrate with other tools.

**Why choose ZeroGTM over black-box AI SDR platforms?**  
Many AI SDR platforms charge $2,000+ per month and hide how they work. ZeroGTM is open-source: you see the pipeline, swap APIs, add steps, and tune prompts. Your leads stay in your database with no sync to third-party clouds. You get GTM engineering as code—transparent, auditable, and customizable.

**Who is ZeroGTM best for?**  
ZeroGTM is best for GTM engineers who want lead enrichment and an email finder tool they can own; teams that need a Google Maps scraper and decision maker discovery without locking data into a vendor; and founders or sales ops looking for the best lead enrichment for sales teams with transparent pricing and a self-host option.

**Does ZeroGTM replace my CRM or email tool?**  
No. ZeroGTM is the *source* layer: it finds and enriches leads (map scrape, email finder, decision makers). You then export or sync those leads into your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) or into a cold email tool (Instantly, Lemlist, etc.). It is designed to feed your existing stack, not replace it.
