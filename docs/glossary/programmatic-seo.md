## What is programmatic SEO?

**Programmatic SEO** is the practice of creating many targeted web pages at scale using structured data and templates, rather than writing each page by hand. Each page is unique (e.g. “[Product] + [Integration]” or “[Product] for [Industry]”) but generated from the same template and a data source (e.g. a list of integrations or verticals). The goal is to rank for long-tail and niche queries (e.g. “Connect Salesforce to Google Sheets,” “CRM for med spas”) with less editorial effort.

## Why it matters

It’s impractical to write hundreds of integration or use-case pages manually. Programmatic SEO lets you capture high-intent, bottom-of-funnel traffic for many variations (integrations, industries, regions) while keeping quality consistent. For AI search (GEO), having many well-structured, topical pages also helps models cite and surface your product for specific queries.

## Key benefits

- **Scale** — One template, many pages; add new integrations or verticals by updating data, not copy.
- **Long-tail capture** — Rank for “[Your product] + [Partner]” and “[Your product] for [Industry]” without writing each from scratch.
- **Internal linking** — Generated pages can link to each other and to core feature/glossary pages, strengthening topical authority.
