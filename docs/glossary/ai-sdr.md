## What is an AI SDR?

An **AI SDR** (AI Sales Development Representative) is an autonomous software agent that handles outbound prospecting and lead qualification—finding leads, enriching contact data, and initiating or supporting outreach at scale. It is distinct from a chatbot: it runs multi-step workflows (e.g. map scrape → [lead enrichment]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) → email verification) and triggers actions in your pipeline, rather than only replying in a conversation.

## Why it matters

Human SDRs are expensive and don’t scale linearly. An AI SDR runs on your infrastructure and APIs: you pay for compute and data, not per seat. That typically means **large cost savings** (e.g. 70%+ vs. a full-time SDR) while keeping control over targeting, messaging, and data. ZeroGTM is built as an open-source AI SDR engine—you own the pipeline and the data.

## Key benefits

- **Cost:** No salary, benefits, or turnover; you pay for APIs and infra.
- **Scale:** Run the same pipeline across many campaigns and geos without adding headcount.
- **Control:** Data stays in your database; you choose enrichment sources and sequences (e.g. [waterfall enrichment]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/2026-02-waterfall-enrichment/)).
- **Speed:** From lead source to verified contact in one automated flow—see [Enrichment pipeline]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/enrichment-pipeline/).
