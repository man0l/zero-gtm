# Lead Enrichment for Custom Home Builders

ZeroGTM helps custom and luxury home builders **fill the pipeline** with qualified leads—**architect and designer referrals**, high-net-worth prospects, and decision makers—using **lead enrichment** and an **email finder** that keep your data in-house.

---

## Built for high-ticket, long-cycle sales

- **Custom home construction leads:** Target by geography and segment; enrich so you have verified emails and the right contact before the first touch. No spraying broad lists.
- **Architect and designer referrals:** Pull and enrich referral sources (architects, interior designers, real estate); find the principal or project lead so partnership and follow-up hit the right inbox.
- **High-net-worth prospects:** DM identification and verification mean you’re reaching the homeowner or decision maker, not a generic info address. Qualify and nurture with data you control.
- **Your data, your stack:** No sending lead lists to a third-party cloud. Run the pipeline on your infra or our hosted tier; approve leads and trigger sequences from the mobile app.

## How it works for custom home builders

1. **Map scrape** — Extract targets by location and category (e.g. architects, designers, related businesses) or ingest lists from your CRM or partners.
2. **Lead enrichment** — Append emails, phones, and socials. See [What is lead enrichment?]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) for the full flow.
3. **DM identification** — Find the principal, project lead, or homeowner contact.
4. **Verification** — Validate emails for deliverability.

Mobile-first: run from the job site or office. No per-seat tax; credits apply to pipeline steps, and BYOK reduces cost further.
