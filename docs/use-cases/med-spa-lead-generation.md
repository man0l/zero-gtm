# The #1 Lead Enrichment Tool for Medical Spas

ZeroGTM turns **Google Maps** and local search into qualified leads for your med spa—**Botox**, **laser hair removal**, **microneedling**, and full body contouring. Find decision makers and verified emails without sending your list to a third-party cloud.

## Stop wasting time on cold lists

- **Service + location intent:** Pull leads by treatment type and geography so you speak to people already searching for what you offer.
- **Ladder of services:** Optimize for specific treatments (Botox, laser, microneedling) alongside business terms so your pipeline matches how clients search.
- **Trust & proof:** Use enriched data to personalize outreach; link to reviews and before/afters where it fits your flow.
- **Fewer no-shows:** Pair ZeroGTM with your scheduling stack—enrich leads before they book so reminders and follow-ups hit the right inbox.

## How it works for med spas

1. **Map scrape** — Extract med spas, clinics, and practices by location and category (or scrape local “customers” for B2B).
2. **Contact mining** — Emails, phones, and socials appended to each lead via our [lead enrichment]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) pipeline.
3. **DM identification** — Find the owner or marketing lead, not just the front desk.
4. **Verification** — Validate emails so your campaigns don’t bounce.

Used by med spas and aesthetics practices to fill the pipeline without paying per-seat or per-contact SaaS fees. Your data stays in your database; run on your infra or our hosted tier.
