# Lead Enrichment for Personal Injury Attorneys

ZeroGTM gives plaintiff firms **lead enrichment** and an **email finder** built for **speed to lead**—so you reach accident and referral leads first. Qualify and follow up with verified contacts without sending your list to a third-party cloud.

## Why speed to lead matters for PI

- **First contact wins:** Accident and referral leads get dozens of firms. Enrich and reach them fast—verified emails and phones so intake and follow-up land in the right inbox.
- **Case intake and referral leads:** Pull and enrich leads by geography and source (e.g. referrals, accident data); find the decision maker or household contact so your outreach is personal, not generic.
- **Stop chasing wrong contacts:** DM identification and verification mean you’re talking to the right person, not a gatekeeper or bad address. Fill your pipeline with qualified PI leads, not noise.
- **Your data, your control:** No sending lead data to a third-party enrichment cloud. Run the pipeline on your infra or our hosted tier; approve leads and trigger sequences from the mobile app.

## How it works for personal injury

1. **Map scrape** — Extract targets by location and category (e.g. related businesses, referral sources, or use external lists for accident/referral leads).
2. **Lead enrichment** — Append emails, phones, and socials. See [What is lead enrichment?]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) for the full flow.
3. **DM identification** — Find the right contact (household, referral source, or business owner).
4. **Verification** — Validate emails for deliverability so intake and follow-up don’t bounce.

Mobile-first: run from your phone so you can respond to hot leads from anywhere. No per-seat tax; credits apply to pipeline steps, and BYOK reduces cost further.
