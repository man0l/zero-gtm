# Lead Enrichment for Real Estate Agents

ZeroGTM helps agents **automate open house follow-ups**, **seller lead generation**, and repeat outreach with **lead enrichment** and an **email finder**—without competing on broad aggregator terms. Built for the jobs agents actually do.

---

## Jobs-to-be-Done for agents

- **Automate open house follow-ups:** Enrich sign-in and show leads with emails and phones; run sequences and reminders so no lead goes cold.
- **Seller lead generation:** Pull and enrich leads by geography and listing type; find decision makers and verified emails for off-market and FSBO outreach.
- **Niche agent needs:** We target workflow and tooling queries (e.g. “automate open house follow-ups,” “seller lead generation”) instead of broad “real estate leads”—so you get a pipeline that fits how you work.
- **Your data, your stack:** No sending lead lists to a third-party cloud. Run the pipeline on your infra or our hosted tier; approve leads and trigger sequences from the mobile app.

## How it works for real estate

1. **Map scrape** — Extract targets (e.g. FSBO, investors, out-of-area agents) by location and category.
2. **Lead enrichment** — Append emails, phones, and socials. See [What is lead enrichment?]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) for the full flow.
3. **DM identification** — Find the owner or listing contact.
4. **Verification** — Validate emails for deliverability.

Mobile-first: run from your phone, swipe to approve leads, and keep pipeline and research in sync. No per-seat tax; credits apply to pipeline steps, and BYOK reduces cost further.
