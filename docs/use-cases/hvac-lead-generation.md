## How it works for HVAC

1. **Map scrape** — Extract contractors, facilities, or residential targets by location and category.
2. **Contact mining** — Emails, phones, and socials appended via our [lead enrichment]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) pipeline.
3. **DM identification** — Find the owner or facility manager.
4. **Verification** — Validate emails so your outreach delivers.

Your data stays in your database. Run on your infra or our hosted tier; no per-seat tax, no sending lead lists to a third-party cloud.
