# Lead Enrichment & Patient Retention for Dental Practices

ZeroGTM gives dental practices **lead enrichment** and an **email finder** tuned for **patient retention** and **filling empty chair time**. Answer the questions patients and staff actually search for—and automate follow-ups so fewer leads go cold.

## Problem-solving for dental

- **Patient retention software for dentists:** Target question-based queries (e.g. “patient retention software for dentists”) and natural-language search. Our content and workflows align with how practices search and how patients ask.
- **Automated appointment reminders:** Use verified emails and phones from the pipeline so reminders and recalls reach the right contact.
- **Filling empty chair time:** Enrich and segment leads so you can run targeted campaigns for high-value treatments (e.g. Invisalign, implants) instead of spraying generic blasts.
- **Stop wasting time on leads who can’t afford Invisalign:** Qualify by firmographics and behavior; focus outreach on leads that match your services.

## How it works for dental

1. **Map scrape** — Pull practices or B2B targets (e.g. DSOs, suppliers) by location and category.
2. **Lead enrichment** — Append emails, phones, and socials. See [What is lead enrichment?]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary/lead-enrichment/) for the full flow.
3. **DM identification** — Find the practice owner or marketing lead.
4. **Verification** — Validate emails for deliverability.

Run the pipeline from the mobile app; approve leads and trigger sequences without sending data to a third-party cloud. Self-host or use our hosted tier.
