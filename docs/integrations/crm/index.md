## Why connect your CRM?

- **Automatically enrich leads** from your CRM in real time (or on schedule).
- **Single source of truth** — verified emails and DMs live in your CRM instead of a separate tool.
- **No data duplication** — run the pipeline on your infra; we don’t store your lists in a third-party cloud.
