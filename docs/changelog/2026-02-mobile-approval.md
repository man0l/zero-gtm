# Mobile approval workflow

**Improvement** · February 1, 2026

You can now **approve or reject leads** in bulk from the ZeroGTM mobile app—swipe to qualify, batch actions, and see job status in real time. Speed to lead doesn’t wait for you to get back to your desk.

---

## Why it matters

GTM teams run on the go. Waiting until you’re at a laptop to approve enriched leads slows down sequences and follow-ups. With the new approval workflow, you can triage leads from your phone: swipe to approve, reject, or defer. Batch actions (e.g. “Approve all on this page”) save time when you’re clearing a queue.

---

## What’s new

- **Swipe to approve/reject** — Thumb-friendly gestures so you can qualify leads one-by-one or in batches.
- **Batch actions** — Select multiple leads and approve, reject, or tag in one tap.
- **Real-time job status** — See scrape, enrichment, and verification jobs update live so you know when new leads are ready to review.

We’ll add a short GIF of the flow in a follow-up. For setup, see [Mobile app docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/mobile-app/).

## How to use it

1. Open the mobile app and go to the lead queue for your campaign.
2. Swipe right to approve, left to reject (or use the action buttons).
3. Use “Select” to choose multiple leads and apply the same action.
4. Approved leads move into the next step of your workflow (e.g. sequences); rejected ones are filtered out.
