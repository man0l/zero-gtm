        "text": "ZeroGTM is an open-source AI SDR and lead enrichment engine. It combines a Google Maps scraper, email finder, and decision-maker discovery into one pipeline you can self-host or run on a hosted tier—aimed at GTM engineers and sales teams who want control and lower cost than human SDRs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Leads are scraped from Google Maps by location and category, then cleaned (website validation). Next, the pipeline finds emails and socials (lead enrichment), identifies decision makers from About pages, and verifies DM emails via an email finder API. Optional steps casualise company names and remove spam. You run each step from the mobile app or via workers."

      "name": "Is ZeroGTM really cheaper than a human SDR?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. In our model, a human SDR costs about $98k/year (compensation, tech, management). ZeroGTM runs at roughly $28k (APIs and ops)—about 71% savings—while keeping pipeline control and signal-driven outreach. Self-hosting reduces cost further to infra and API spend only."
