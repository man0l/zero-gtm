Optional steps include casualise company names and clean spam. You run each step from the mobile app or via workers."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. ZeroGTM is open-source. You can run the backend (Supabase or compatible), workers, and optional Edge Functions on your own infrastructure. Your data stays in your PostgreSQL; no lead data is sent to third-party clouds. BYOK (bring your own API keys) is supported for Google Maps, email finder, and enrichment APIs."
