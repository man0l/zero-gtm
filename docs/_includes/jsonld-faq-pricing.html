        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. When you provide your own API key for a service (RapidAPI, OpenWeb Ninja, Anymail Finder, OpenAI/Anthropic), that step runs with your key and does not consume your plan credits. You only pay your API provider; ZeroGTM does not charge for that step."

        "text": "Self-hosted means you run the backend (Supabase or compatible), workers, and optional Edge Functions on your own infrastructure. There are no per-seat or per-credit fees from ZeroGTM—you pay only for your APIs and compute. Full pipeline: Google Maps scraper, lead enrichment, email finder, decision maker discovery."
