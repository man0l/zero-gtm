      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A human SDR typically costs about $98,000 per year (compensation, tech stack, management). ZeroGTM runs at roughly $28,000 per year (APIs and ops)—about 71% savings—while keeping pipeline control and signal-driven outreach. You keep the same workflow: approve leads, trigger sequences, and own the data."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Apollo and Clay are closed-source, cloud-only platforms with per-seat or usage-based pricing and data stored in their systems. ZeroGTM is open-source: you see and own the pipeline (Google Maps scrape, lead enrichment, email finder, decision maker discovery). You can self-host so leads stay in your database, use BYOK to avoid credit burn, and customize steps and APIs without vendor lock-in."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Instantly and similar tools focus on sending and sequences. ZeroGTM focuses on the front of the funnel: finding and enriching leads (Google Maps scraper, email finder, decision maker discovery). It is built for GTM engineers who want a single pipeline from map scrape to verified contacts, then use their own sending stack or integrate with other tools. Best for teams that need lead enrichment software and an email finder tool they can own and self-host."

      "name": "Why choose ZeroGTM over black-box AI SDR platforms?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many AI SDR platforms charge $2,000+ per month and hide how they work. ZeroGTM is open-source: you see the pipeline, swap APIs, add steps, and tune prompts. Your leads stay in your database with no sync to third-party clouds. You get GTM engineering as code—transparent, auditable, and customizable."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ZeroGTM is best for GTM engineers who want lead enrichment and an email finder tool they can own; teams that need a Google Maps scraper and decision maker discovery without locking data into a vendor; and founders or sales ops looking for the best lead enrichment for sales teams with transparent pricing and a self-host option."

      "name": "Does ZeroGTM replace my CRM or email tool?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. ZeroGTM is the source layer: it finds and enriches leads (map scrape, email finder, decision makers). You then export or sync those leads into your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) or into a cold email tool (Instantly, Lemlist, etc.). It is designed to feed your existing stack, not replace it."
